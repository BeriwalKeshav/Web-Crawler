# Web-Crawler
In the project I've made a Web Crawler using Scrapy and requests library in python.
I have defined my own spider which basically crawls the site- pepperfry.com and extarcts data about different products.
To be specefic-
I have taken a list of 11 products. The Spider goes to each product and extracts all the information (images, title, price and product decription) 
about 20 varities(maximum) of each product, and stores it in a well formed directory structure.
